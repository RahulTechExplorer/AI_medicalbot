🩺 AI Medical Diagnosis Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered medical diagnosis chatbot that combines YOLO image detection, Google Gemini AI, and multilingual voice-based communication to provide preliminary medical insights. Users can upload medical scans such as X-rays, CT, or MRI images, ask health-related questions through text or voice, and receive AI-generated responses in multiple languages. The chatbot focuses on accessibility, simplicity, and intelligent human-computer interaction, making medical information more understandable and engaging.
